# gnujdb

The goal of this project is to expose a central database of items collected in
Hackerspace Łódź. The project generates QR codes like this:

All of them point to https://g.hs-ldz.pl/ + some random suffix. Once you visit
the URL, you can see a website like this:

Here you can upload an image of the object you attached the sticker to, who
is the owner, on what terms the object can be used, how much it's worth and
any other extra information. The data can then be viewed and edited by anyone
who either has an access to the link or the sticker. If the sticker wears off,
the text below it says what should be entered after https://g.hs-ldz.pl/
prefix.
